	abstract = {Plate and spring reverberators are electromechanical systems ﬁrst used and researched as means to substitute real room reverberation. Currently, they are often used in music production for aesthetic reasons due to their particular sonic characteristics. The modeling of these audio processors and their perceptual qualities is difﬁcult since they use mechanical elements together with analog electronics resulting in an extremely complex response. Based on digital reverberators that use sparse {FIR} ﬁlters, we propose a signal processinginformed deep learning architecture for the modeling of artiﬁcial reverberators. We explore the capabilities of deep neural networks to learn such highly nonlinear electromechanical responses and we perform modeling of plate and spring reverberators. In order to measure the performance of the model, we conduct a perceptual evaluation experiment and we also analyze how the given task is accomplished and what the model is actually learning.},

A variety of theories to describe the dynamic behaviour of these structural elements, which involves interaction of flexural, torsion and longitudinal waves, can be found in the literature. Alongside this, various approximate methods are employed to determine the eigenfrequencies of vibrations of springs. In this paper, the validity ranges of alternative theories are assessed by comparison of the location of the dispersion curves. This paper also contains a rigorous asymptotic analysis of the exact dispersion equation with two small parameters being employed. It allows for the identification of significant regimes of linear wave motion in a helical spring. In each of these regimes, simple formulae for wavenumbers are obtained by the dominant balance method and their validity ranges are checked against direct numerical solution. Mode shapes associated with each wavenumber are also analysed.},

	abstract = {Virtual analog modeling of spring reverberation presents a challenging problem to the algorithm designer, regardless of the particular strategy employed. The difﬁculties lie in the behaviour of the helical spring, which, due to its inherent curvature, shows characteristics of both coherent and dispersive wave propagation. Though it is possible to emulate such effects in an efﬁcient manner using audio signal processing constructs such as delay lines (for coherent wave propagation) and chains of allpass ﬁlters (for dispersive wave propagation), another approach is to make use of direct numerical simulation techniques, such as the ﬁnite difference time domain method ({FDTD}) in order to solve the equations of motion directly. Such an approach, though more computationally intensive, allows a closer link with the underlying model system—and yet, there are severe numerical difﬁculties associated with such designs, and in particular anomalous numerical dispersion, requiring some care at the design stage. In this paper, a complete model of helical spring vibration is presented; dispersion analysis from an audio perspective allows for model simpliﬁcation. A detailed description of novel {FDTD} designs follows, with special attention is paid to issues such as numerical stability, loss modeling, numerical boundary conditions, and computational complexity. Simulation results are presented.},

In this paper, an automated calibration of the model parameters is proposed, by analysing the spectrogram, the energy decay curve, the spectrum, and the autocorrelation of the time signal and spectrogram. A visual inspection of the spectrograms as well as a comparison of sound samples proves the approach to be successful for estimating the parameters of reverberators with one, two and three springs. This indicates that the proposed method is a viable alternative to manual calibration of spring reverberator models.},

Traditional processes are non-linear, and can produce signiﬁcant distortion of the processed signal. In this paper we present a new linear technique that reduces the peak amplitude of transient signals using golden ratio allpass ﬁlters. The system is applied to test signals consisting of both isolated musical sounds and mixed musical audio. The average reduction of the peak amplitude of the musical passages considered is 2.5dB. The system can be applied alongside non-linear methods, to reduce the distortion associated with a particular reduction in peak amplitude.},

Spring reverberation is an example of such a system—a spring exhibits complex, highly dispersive behavior, including coupling between different types of wave propagation (longitudinal and transverse). Standard numerical techniques, such as ﬁnite difference schemes are a good match to such a problem, but require specialized design and analysis techniques in the context of audio processing. A model of helical spring vibration is introduced, along with a family of ﬁnite difference schemes suitable for time domain simulation. Various topics are covered, including numerical stability conditions, tuning of the scheme to the response of the model system, numerical boundary conditions and connection to an excitation and readout, implementation details, as well as computational requirements. Simulation results are presented, and full energy-based stability analysis appears in an Appendix.},
