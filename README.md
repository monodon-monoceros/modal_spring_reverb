# Modal Spring Reverb

Implementation of a *crappy* physical spring reverb model in Faust using modal synthesis.

---

## To Do:

* Improvement of Model in Matlab
   * Modelling of frequency dependend attenuation
   * Modelling of Longitudinal/Torsional Waves
   * **How many Modes are Useful??**
   * Lookuptable for biquads Filter coefficients?
* embed Algorithm in Feedback Structure maybe with Statevariable Filter
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_variable_filter
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89rPF9J5f3A  
* Design UI
  * changeable Parameters
    * test    
* How to change Parameter in Realtime?   

* Learning Faust
* Implementation in Faust
   * Plugin
   * Embedded Devices - RPi
